1. GC Content of the variant:

The percentage of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) nucleotides in the DNA sequence.
Calculation:

def gc_content(sequence):
    g = sequence.count('G')
    c = sequence.count('C')
    return (g + c) / len(sequence) * 100
	
2. K-fold energy of the variant with sliding window length 40:
Calculation of folding energies using a sliding window approach over the sequence.
Calculation:
This typically involves using bioinformatics tools like RNAfold to compute folding energies over sliding windows of the sequence.

3. K-fold energy of the variant:

Overall folding energy calculation of the sequence.
Calculation:
Similar to point 2, using tools like RNAfold.

4. Difference between the variant folding energy and the Control:

Comparing the variant's folding energy with a control sequence.
Calculation:
def energy_difference(variant_energy, control_energy):
    return variant_energy - control_energy
	
5. Hybridization energy of Anti-SD with sliding window length 6:

Calculation of hybridization energy with a specific sequence (Anti-SD) over sliding windows.
Calculation:
This would involve specific bioinformatics tools designed for hybridization energy calculations.
	
6. Count and location of mutations in the variant compared to the Control:

Counting the number of mutations and identifying their locations.
Calculation:
def count_mutations(variant_sequence, control_sequence):
    mutations = [(i, v) for i, (v, c) in enumerate(zip(variant_sequence, control_sequence)) if v != c]
    return len(mutations), mutations	


7. Count of codons that have been replaced in the variant compared to the Control:

Counting the number of codon changes.
Calculation:
def count_codon_changes(variant_sequence, control_sequence):
    codons_variant = [variant_sequence[i:i+3] for i in range(0, len(variant_sequence), 3)]
    codons_control = [control_sequence[i:i+3] for i in range(0, len(control_sequence), 3)]
    changes = [(i, v) for i, (v, c) in enumerate(zip(codons_variant, codons_control)) if v != c]
    return len(changes), changes
	
8. ChimeraARS sequence features of the variant (more on Chimera - throughout the course):

This refers to specific sequence features derived from ChimeraARS.
Calculation:
Specific details would depend on the ChimeraARS tool and its outputs.


9. tAI and CAI of tRNA and ORF of E. coli:

tRNA Adaptation Index (tAI) and Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) are measures of translation efficiency.
Calculation:
This involves bioinformatics calculations typically done using specialized software or scripts.

PSSM Z-score profiles of 12 selected motifs in E. coli genomes (more on motifs - throughout the course):

Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) Z-scores for selected motifs.
Calculation:
Requires motif analysis tools that generate PSSM - did it in hw 3 and Z-scores.
